# BrickQuest — Project Notes

## What is BrickQuest?

A multiplayer tabletop arena game. Players use colored "bricks" as abilities in real-time combat. DM controls the encounter via a separate screen. Runs on local network — players use phones, DM uses laptop.

## Brick Colors & Actions

| Brick | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Red | Charge toward target — deals damage, bounces goblin |
| White | Tap=instant heal, Drag=regen over time |
| Yellow | Confuse in radius — random movement, halved attack speed |
| Blue | Homing bolt to target — impact burst |
| Orange | Tap=trap at feet, Drag=sealed trap at point, bleed on release |
| Gray | Tap=armor pips, Drag=expanding wall |
| Green | Expanding ring push + poison |
| Purple | Expanding burst — heals player for damage dealt |
| Black | Darkness zone — pulls goblins, damage ticks, slow debuff |

**Canonical hex values** (in `BRICK_COLORS` constant):
red `#E24B4A`, blue `#006DB7`, green `#1D9E75`, white `#EFEFEF`, gray `#5e6a7a`, purple `#7B2FBE`, yellow `#F5D000`, orange `#F57C00`, black `#333333`. Gray was `#AAAAAA` but was visually indistinguishable from white on the brick bar — moved to slate.

Brick buttons render as solid-colored rounded squares (no emoji icons) with an inset bevel shadow for a brick feel. Qty badge top-right, pips anchored bottom.

Overload: hold brick button in place to charge — each tier costs 1 brick charge, increases power. Tier duration is 0.9s (was 0.5s; raised because taps on Android regularly exceeded 0.5s and accidentally triggered overload).

**Drag vs. overload dispatch.** A drag (finger moved > 20px) always wins over a hold. Rules at release:
- Drag only → fire the brick's drag handler at release point, consume 1 brick
- Drag + held ≥ tier duration → `fireOverload(x, y, n)` at release point (overload drag)
- Held ≥ tier duration in place → `fireOverload(undefined, undefined, n)` at player
- Quick tap → single brick action at player

This ordering matters: if "held" beat "dragged," long drags across the screen would always overload instead of placing the effect where the player dragged it.

## Class System

| Class | HP | Speed | Signature | Starting Bricks |
|-------|----|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Warrior | 16 | 170 | Red 0.8s | red×3, gray×2, white×1 |
| Wizard | 8 | 195 | Blue 1.5s | blue×2, black×1, yellow×1, purple×1 |
| Scout | 12 | 260 | Orange 1s | orange×3, blue×1, red×1 |
| Builder | 14 | 150 | Gray 0.7s | gray×4, orange×2, white×1 |
| Mender | 10 | 160 | White 0.8s | white×3, purple×2, yellow×1 |
| Beastcaller | 12 | 220 | Green 0.9s | green×3, yellow×2, orange×1 |

## Skill Paths (designed, not yet built)

Each class has two paths. Examples:
- Warrior: Wrath (red gets stronger per hit) vs Bastion (armor converts to damage)
- Wizard: Puppetmaster (confuse + darkness combo) vs Conduit (debuffs boost bolt)
- Scout: Ambush (traps hit harder the longer dormant) vs Blur (dash leaves poison)
- Builder: Siege (walls explode when broken) vs Recycle (traps/walls reset on kill)
- Mender: Lifeline (damage triggers regen pulse) vs Drain (heal scales with target missing HP)
- Beastcaller: Plague (poison spreads on death) vs Herder (confuse becomes directional)

## Arena Test — Technical Notes

- Single HTML file, no dependencies
- Canvas 2D rendering
- Touch events for Android/iOS
- Local network server: `bash serve.sh` on Mac
- Class buttons use `<button>` elements with `onclick` handlers
- Canvas touch listeners added AFTER class selection to avoid blocking overlay
- `updateHUD()` uses null-safe element setters (elements may be hidden)
- Brick bar split: left col (black/yellow/green/gray/white), right col (red/blue/orange/purple)
- Zero-count bricks not rendered

### DPR-aware canvas sizing

The canvas must be sized in two coordinate spaces: backing store (physical pixels) and CSS (logical pixels). `resize()` does:

```js
canvas.width  = cssW * dpr;  // backing store — sharp on hi-DPI
canvas.height = cssH * dpr;
canvas.style.width  = cssW + 'px';  // CSS display size
canvas.style.height = cssH + 'px';
ctx.setTransform(dpr, 0, 0, dpr, 0, 0);  // drawing code uses CSS pixels
```

All touch→canvas coord mapping is then 1:1 via `rect.left`/`rect.top` subtraction — **do not** multiply by `canvas.width / rect.width` (that gives physical pixels and breaks hit-testing). Do NOT put `width:100vw; height:100vh` in the canvas CSS — it fights the JS-set inline sizes, and on Android Chrome `100vh ≠ innerHeight` during URL-bar transitions, which visibly stretches circles into ovals.

### Floating text rendering

There's ONE draw path for `floatingTexts`: the monkey-patched `draw` wrapper that runs after `_origDraw()`. The original `draw()` must NOT also iterate `floatingTexts` — doing so decrements alpha twice per frame and damage numbers vanish before they can be seen. If you're adding a new effect layer, put it in the wrapper, not the base.

### Ghost-click guard on brick buttons

Android fires both `touchstart` and a synthetic `mousedown` ~300ms later. Without a guard, `onBrickDown` registers two copies of document listeners per press. Guard: record `_lastTouchBrickTime` on touchstart; on mousedown within 600ms, bail. Also `_brickDownActive` flag prevents re-entry from a second finger.

### HP numbers above bars

Draw order matters. The HP bar's dark background paints over text if text is drawn first. Current order: bar → numbers-on-top with a 3px black stroke for readability on any background. Goblin HP numbers were previously `#151528` (invisible on the dark arena) — now white-with-stroke.

### Red charge visuals

Charge speed is `player.speed × 2.6` (was ×4, too fast to see). Every frame of the charge phase emits 3 trail particles behind the player AND records player position into `brickAction._trail` (max 12 points); the streak is rendered as fading red-orange line segments under the player with `shadowBlur` glow.

## Android Issues Resolved

- Class selection buttons blocked by canvas touch listeners → fixed by deferring canvas listeners
- `updateHUD()` crashing on missing DOM elements → fixed with null-safe setters
- Canvas colors too dark to see → class colors brightened
- Characters oblong → canvas CSS size set to match pixel size exactly; later resolved properly with DPR-aware sizing (see Technical Notes)
- Overload triggered on every tap → OVERLOAD_TIER raised 0.5s → 0.9s
- Drag-to-target ignored on long drags → dispatch reordered so drag beats hold (see Technical Notes)
- Double-firing brick actions from touch + synthetic mouse → ghost-click guard added
- Damage numbers invisible / flickering off instantly → removed duplicate floating-text loop from original `draw()`
- Goblin HP numbers invisible → changed from `#151528` to white-with-stroke
- Gray and white bricks indistinguishable → gray moved from `#AAAAAA` to `#5e6a7a` slate
- Red charge had no visual feedback → slowed speed, added per-frame trail particles + position streak

## Goblin Stats

- HP: 60, attack: 3 dmg, cooldown: 1.8s
- Goblin types planned: Brute (100hp/5dmg/slow), Scout (35hp/2dmg/fast), Shaman (heals allies)

## File Delivery Note
